# Web-Based Widgets
Considering the 10 heuristics of user interface design, it is important to ensure that your primary audience is aware of the systemâ€™s status and its perceived affordance. In this case, as a project manager is it beneficial to know what stage their project is at and how to progress through the milestones. Or in other aspects, highlighting the option chosen when filling out an assessment form. As a change coordinator interested in software development, I added suggestions and built out widgets for the IT internal project websites. Making the interface visual and intuitive.
